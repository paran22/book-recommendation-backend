      "내용: “정말 그럴 때가 있을 겁니다. 어디 가나 벽이고 무인도이고 혼자라는 생각이 들 때가 있을 겁니다.” 이어령님의 <정말 그럴 때가>라는 시의 첫 구절이다. 살다 보면 누구나 외롭고 힘든 순간이 있다. 그럴 때 누군가의 따뜻한 말 한마디, 내 마음을 대변하는 것 같은 책 속 한 문장이 큰 위로가 되기도 한다. 이 책의 저자는 정신건강의학과 전문의로 시와 마음은 많이 닮았다고 말한다. 짧지만 긴 시간을 들여 천천히 읽어야 이해할 수 있는 시처럼, 사람의 마음도 겉으로 드러나는 단편적인 기분보다 실상 더 복잡하고 많은 감정이 담겨있어 가만히 들여다보아야만 이해할 수 있게 된다는 것이다. 나도 몰랐던 현재의 내 마음을 발견하고, 과거의 관계에서 생긴 마음의 매듭들을 풀며, 더 나은 미래를 위해 갖춰야 할 태도들에 대해 생각해 볼 수 있는 시들을 상황에 맞게 소개하고 있다. 더 나아가 심리 이론으로 촘촘한 분석과 구체적인 해결책을 제시한다. 과거의 선택을 후회하고, 현실이 힘들고, 미래가 불안한 이들에게 이 책을 권하고 싶다. 시가 건네는 위로를 발견할 수 있기를.\n",

      "내용: 이 책의 저자는 자신이 상담해 왔던 환자들의 이야기를 통해 현대 사회에서 흔하게 겪게 되는 감정의 문제들을 적고 각 사례들에 대한 정보와 처방전을 이야기해 주고 있다. 1부에서는 자존감이 낮거나 높은 사람들이 겪을 수 있는 문제를, 2부에서는 자라나지 못한 마음속의 아이들이라는 주제로 아이들이 겪는 아픔을, 3부에서는 상처받기 쉬운 가족이라는 주제로 가장 가까운 가족들에게 받는 상처를, 4부에서는 남자와 여자 그리고 결혼이라는 주제로 부부관계에서 어떻게 해야 잘 헤쳐 나갈 수 있는지 이야기하고 있으며, 5부에서는 장애와 통증 사이 내가 혹시 이런 병에 걸린 것은 아닐까라는 주제로 스트레스로 인한 장애가 생길 수도 있다고 이야기하고 있다. 우울이라는 단어는 현대 사회를 살아가는 사람이라면 한 번쯤 떠올릴 수 있다. 고단한 회사 생활, 초년생으로서 힘든 사회 활동, 학생으로서 느끼는 학업 스트레스, 엄마이지만 한 사람의 여성으로서 느끼는 고단함 등에서 누구나 격을 수 있다. 이 책을 통해서 마음에 무거운 짐을 안고 있는 사람들에게 작은 위로를 건네는 책이다. “까짓것 우울하면 좀 어때?!”\n",
